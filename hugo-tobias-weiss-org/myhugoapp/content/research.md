# Research and Publications

My research focuses on the intersection of emerging technologies and their impact on digital sovereignty and human-computer interaction.

## Core Research Areas:

### 1. Digital Sovereignty in the Age of AI
Exploring the socio-technical implications of large-scale AI models and the necessity of open-source, sovereign infrastructure. Key areas include:
*   Decentralized model training and execution.
*   Privacy-preserving data analytics.
*   Mitigating vendor lock-in in critical infrastructure.

### 2. Immersive Educational Environments (XR)
Investigating the application of eXtended Reality (XR) for learning complex subjects like chemistry and physics.
*   **Social VR:** Utilizing platforms like Mozilla Hubs for collaborative scientific exploration.
*   **Data Visualization:** Developing 3D data mapping and interactive simulations.

### 3. Human-Centric AI Operations (DevOps)
Bridging advanced AI capabilities with robust, maintainable operational workflows.
*   Automating lifecycle management for machine learning models (MLOps).
*   Scaling sovereign cloud architectures.

## Publications and Resources:

**Publication Ethics Statement:** To address the exploitative revenue models of traditional academic publishers, my latest research is shared exclusively as a preprint. It is not published with any traditional publisher or journal, adhering to principles of open access and digital sovereignty.

### Latest Research:
*   **[Interference Timing of GenAI Sales Agents in Virtual Reality](/interference-timing-genai-vr/)** (December 2024) - Analyzes how AI agent timing impacts user experience and perception in VR commerce.
