# Impact of GenAI Sales Agent Timing in VR Commerce

**Authors:** Tobias Weiss, Asmus Eike Eilks, Jella Pfeiffer
**Research:** [Preprint available (December 2024)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/386557161_Interference_Timing_of_GenAI_Sales_Agents_in_Virtual_Reality)

## Study Overview:

This study investigates the impact of artificial sales agent interference timing on user experience within Virtual Reality (VR) commerce environments. We conducted a controlled experiment with 100 participants in a VR showroom, comparing immediate versus delayed agent assistance.

The AI sales agent integrated a comprehensive pipeline: speech-to-text (STT), a large language model (LLM), and text-to-speech (TTS).

## Key Findings:

*   **Timing is Crucial:** The timing of the initial GenAI sales agent interaction significantly affects user experience in VR commerce.
*   **Immediate Assistance Advantage:** Immediate agent intervention resulted in superior user experience outcomes compared to delayed assistance.
*   **Warmth as a Mediator:** The positive impact of immediate intervention is primarily driven by the agent's perceived **warmth** (friendliness, helpfulness), rather than perceived competence.
*   **Reduced "Uncanny Valley":** Participants found the immediate interference condition less "uncanny" than adaptive or delayed assistance.
*   **Technical Feasibility:** The study confirms the technical viability of implementing advanced, multi-stage AI pipelines for real-time sales agents in virtual commerce scenarios.
