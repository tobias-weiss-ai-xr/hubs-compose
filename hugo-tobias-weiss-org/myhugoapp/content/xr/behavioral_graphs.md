# Behavioral Graphs: Enhancing XR Interaction

Behavioral Graphs (BGs) represent an innovative extension to platforms like Mozilla Hubs, designed to enrich XR environments with interactive features. We believe BGs offer a significant advancement beyond traditional "gallery-like" scenes, pushing the boundaries of user engagement in virtual spaces.

## What are Behavioral Graphs?

Behavioral Graphs are dynamic, data-driven systems that analyze and respond to user actions within XR environments. They enable more personalized and interactive experiences by modeling user behavior and providing context-aware assistance or content.

## Key Benefits for XR Platforms:

*   **Enhanced User Engagement:** Create more captivating and responsive virtual experiences.
*   **Personalized Interactions:** Tailor content and assistance based on user behavior.
*   **Deeper Insights:** Analyze user patterns to optimize environment design and functionality.
