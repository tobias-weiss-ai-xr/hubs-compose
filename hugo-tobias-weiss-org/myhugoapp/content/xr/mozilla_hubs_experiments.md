# Mozilla Hubs XR Experiments: Enhancing Educational Spaces

This section details experiments with Mozilla Hubs, exploring its application in university teaching and creating immersive learning environments. Our goal is to represent complex subjects, like the periodic table, as interactive networks of virtual spaces.

## Project Overview: The Periodic Table in VR

We are developing virtual environments where each element has its own dedicated space, enriched with relevant information. For example, nitrogen's space could illustrate the formation of nitrogen oxides in car traffic or its role in fertilizer production.

This project follows an iterative approach, refining an initial prototype based on Design Science Research principles. This ensures:

*   **Learner Experience:** Optimizing for the most effective and positive user experience.
*   **Educator Benefit:** Enabling teachers to leverage these virtual spaces for future projects and transfer knowledge to other contexts.

We present results from a study of 40 observations comparing learning spaces built with Mozilla Hubs, applying principles from multimedia learning theory to enhance perceived learning success.

## Specific XR Learning Room Experiments:
