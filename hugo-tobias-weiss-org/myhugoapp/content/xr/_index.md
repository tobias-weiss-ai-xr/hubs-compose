# Extended Reality (XR) Research and Projects

Explore my research into the intersection of emerging technologies and their impact on human-computer interaction. My work focuses on **Extended Reality (XR)**, encompassing Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), with a particular emphasis on their application in commercial and educational contexts.

## Core Research Areas:

### 1. Digital Sovereignty in AI & XR
Investigating the socio-technical implications of AI and XR, focusing on open-source infrastructure, privacy-preserving analytics, and mitigating vendor lock-in.

### 2. Immersive Educational Environments
Developing XR applications for learning complex subjects. This includes leveraging **Mozilla Hubs** for collaborative scientific exploration and creating 3D data visualizations.

### 3. Human-Centric AI Operations
Integrating AI capabilities into robust, maintainable operational workflows, including automating Machine Learning Operations (MLOps).

## Key Publications & Experiments:
